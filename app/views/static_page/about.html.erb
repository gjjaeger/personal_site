    <span class="about-me-text">My surname "Jaeger" means hunter in German and describes me very well as a person. While I don't eat meat, I am always chasing a goal and don't give up until I conquer it. This is a trait that is represented in all my work. There is no challenge that I will not overcome.
    </br>
    </br>
    I am a citizen of the world and have lived on all sides of the planet. I speak 3 languages fluently and love adventures and travel.</span>

    </div>
    <span class="my-places-text">I was born in Paderborn, a small town in the center of Germany. I spent my teenage years in Singapore. Upon graduation from high school I relocated to Canada where I graduated with a Degree in Business from a top Business School.
    <br>
    <br>
    After working in the start up industry in Paris for almost a year, I decided to further my skillset and relocated to Hong Kong to receive an education as a Software Engineer.
    <br>
    <br>
    My dream is to sail around the world. May the wind guide me.
